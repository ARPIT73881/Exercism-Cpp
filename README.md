- ### About C++
 
    - **C++** (pronounced _cee plus plus_) is a general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. It is immensely popular, especially for applications that require speed and/or access to low-level features. C++ is considered an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high-level and low-level language features.

    - C++ supports multiple programming paradigms:

        - Procedural
        - Object-oriented
        - Functional
        - Generic programming

    - Compilers for C++ are available for nearly every platform, including:

        - Windows
        - Mac OS
        - Linux

- ###  Key Benefits

    - **Type safety**: Encapsulates necessary unsafe operations.
    - **Resource safety**: Manages more than just memory resources.
    - **Performance**: Crucial for systems where speed matters.
    - **Predictability**: Suitable for both hard and soft real-time systems.
    - **Teachability**: Complexity is proportional to the task at hand.
    - **Readability**: Code is designed to be understandable by both people and machines (analyzability).
    - **Direct map to hardware**: Maps instructions and fundamental data types directly to hardware.
    - **Zero-overhead abstraction**: Supports features like constructors, destructors, inheritance, generic programming, and functional programming techniques without performance penalties.

- ###  C++ Standard

    - The standard for C++ is maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The current version of C++ as of June 2018 is **C++17**, which signifies that the standard was ratified in 2017 (not the 17th version of C++).

- ###  Versatility

    - C++ runs on a wide range of devices:

        - Embedded processors with limited resources
        - Mainframe supercomputers
        - Personal computers of all sizes

This respository was inspired by the work of [Exercism](https://exercism.org/). Their creativity and innovation motivated me to build my own version.
